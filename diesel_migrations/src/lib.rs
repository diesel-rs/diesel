//! Provides functions for maintaining database schema.
//!
//! A database migration always provides procedures to update the schema, as well as to revert
//! itself. Diesel's migrations are versioned, and run in order. Diesel also takes care of tracking
//! which migrations have already been run automatically. Your migrations don't need to be
//! idempotent, as Diesel will ensure no migration is run twice unless it has been reverted.
//!
//! Migrations should be placed in a `/migrations` directory at the root of your project (the same
//! directory as `Cargo.toml`). When any of these functions are run, Diesel will search for the
//! migrations directory in the current directory and its parents, stopping when it finds the
//! directory containing `Cargo.toml`.
//!
//! Individual migrations should be a folder containing exactly two files, `up.sql` and `down.sql`.
//! `up.sql` will be used to run the migration, while `down.sql` will be used for reverting it. The
//! folder itself should have the structure `{version}_{migration_name}`. It is recommended that
//! you use the timestamp of creation for the version.
//!
//! Migrations can either be run with the CLI or embedded into the compiled application
//! and executed with code, for example right after establishing a database connection.
//! For more information, consult the [`embed_migrations!`](macro.embed_migrations.html) macro.
//!
//! ## Example
//!
//! ```text
//! # Directory Structure
//! - 20151219180527_create_users
//!     - up.sql
//!     - down.sql
//! - 20160107082941_create_posts
//!     - up.sql
//!     - down.sql
//! ```
//!
//! ```sql
//! -- 20151219180527_create_users/up.sql
//! CREATE TABLE users (
//!   id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
//!   name VARCHAR NOT NULL,
//!   hair_color VARCHAR
//! );
//! ```
//!
//! ```sql
//! -- 20151219180527_create_users/down.sql
//! DROP TABLE users;
//! ```
//!
//! ```sql
//! -- 20160107082941_create_posts/up.sql
//! CREATE TABLE posts (
//!   id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
//!   user_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
//!   title VARCHAR NOT NULL,
//!   body TEXT
//! );
//! ```
//!
//! ```sql
//! -- 20160107082941_create_posts/down.sql
//! DROP TABLE posts;

/// This macro will read your migrations at compile time, and embed a module you can use to execute
/// them at runtime without the migration files being present on the file system. This is useful if
/// you would like to use Diesel's migration infrastructure, but want to ship a single executable
/// file (such as for embedded applications). It can also be used to apply migrations to an in
/// memory database (Diesel does this for its own test suite).
///
/// You can optionally pass the path to the migrations directory to this macro. When left
/// unspecified, Diesel Codegen will search for the migrations directory in the same way that
/// Diesel CLI does. If specified, the path should be relative to the directory where `Cargo.toml`
/// resides.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```rust
/// # #[macro_use] extern crate diesel;
/// # #[macro_use] extern crate diesel_migrations;
/// # include!("../../diesel/src/doctest_setup.rs");
/// # table! {
/// #   users {
/// #       id -> Integer,
/// #       name -> VarChar,
/// #   }
/// # }
/// #
/// # #[cfg(feature = "postgres")]
/// # embed_migrations!("../migrations/postgresql");
/// # #[cfg(all(feature = "mysql", not(feature = "postgres")))]

/// embed_migrations!("../migrations/sqlite");
///
/// fn main() {

///     // This will run the necessary migrations.
///     embedded_migrations::run(&connection);
///
///     // By default the output is thrown out. If you want to redirect it to stdout, you

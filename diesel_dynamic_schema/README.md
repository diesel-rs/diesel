API Documentation: [latest release](https://docs.rs/diesel-dynamic-schema)

Diesel is built to provide strong compile time guarantees that your queries are
valid. To do this, it needs to represent your schema at compile time. However,
there are some times where you don't actually know the schema you're interacting
with until runtime.

This crate provides tools to work with those cases, while still being able to
use Diesel's query builder. Keep in mind that many compile time guarantees are
lost. We cannot verify that the tables/columns you ask for actually exist, or
that the types you state are correct.

## Getting Started

The main function used by this crate is `table`. Note that you must always
provide an explicit select clause when using this crate.

```rust
use diesel_dynamic_schema::table;

let users = table("users");
let id = users.column::<Integer, _>("id");
let name = users.column::<Text, _>("name");

users.select((id, name))
    .filter(name.eq("Sean"))
    .first(&conn)
```

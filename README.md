Diesel gets rid of the boilerplate for database interaction and eliminates
runtime errors without sacrificing performance. It takes full advantage of
Rust's type system to create a low overhead query builder that "feels like
Rust."

Supported databases:
1. [PostgreSQL](https://docs.diesel.rs/diesel/pg/index.html)
2. [MySQL](https://docs.diesel.rs/diesel/mysql/index.html)
3. [SQLite](https://docs.diesel.rs/diesel/sqlite/index.html)

You can configure the database backend in `Cargo.toml`:
```toml
[dependencies]
diesel = { version = "<version>", features = ["<postgres|mysql|sqlite>"] }
```

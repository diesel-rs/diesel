/// This macro will read your migrations at compile time, and embed a module you can use to execute
/// them at runtime without the migration files being present on the file system. This is useful if

/// file (such as for embedded applications). It can also be used to apply migrations to an in
/// memory database (Diesel does this for its own test suite).
///
/// You can optionally pass the path to the migrations directory to this macro. When left
/// unspecified, Diesel Codegen will search for the migrations directory in the same way that
/// Diesel CLI does. If specified, the path should be relative to the directory where `Cargo.toml`
/// resides.
///
/// This macro can only be used in combination with the `diesel_codegen` or

/// ```rust
/// # #[macro_use] extern crate diesel;
/// # #[macro_use] extern crate diesel_codegen;
/// # include!("src/doctest_setup.rs");
/// # table! {
/// #   users {

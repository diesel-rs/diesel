/// Trait indicating that a record can be queried from the database.
///
/// Types which implement `Queryable` represent the result of a SQL query. This
/// does not necessarily mean they represent a single database table.
///
/// This trait can be derived automatically using `#[derive(Queryable)]`. This
/// trait can only be derived for structs, not enums.
///
/// Diesel represents the return type of a query as a tuple. The purpose of this
/// trait is to convert from a tuple of Rust values that have been deserialized
/// into your struct.
///
/// When this trait is derived, it will assume that the order of fields on your
/// struct match the order of the fields in the query. This means that field
/// order is significant if you are using `#[derive(Queryable)]`. Field name has
/// no affect.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// If we just want to map a query to our struct, we can use `derive`.
///
/// ```rust
/// # #[macro_use] extern crate diesel;
/// # include!("../doctest_setup.rs");
/// #
/// #[derive(Queryable, PartialEq, Debug)]
/// struct User {
///     id: i32,
///     name: String,
/// }
///
/// # fn main() {
/// #     run_test();
/// # }
/// #
/// # fn run_test() -> QueryResult<()> {
/// #     use schema::users::dsl::*;
/// #     let connection = establish_connection();
/// let first_user = users.first(&connection)?;
/// let expected = User { id: 1, name: "Sean".into() };
/// assert_eq!(expected, first_user);
/// #     Ok(())
/// # }
/// ```
///
/// If we want to do additional work during deserialization, we can implement
/// the trait ourselves.
///
/// ```rust
/// # #[macro_use] extern crate diesel;
/// # include!("../doctest_setup.rs");
/// #
/// use schema::users;
/// use diesel::query_source::Queryable;
///
/// # /*
/// type DB = diesel::sqlite::Sqlite;
/// # */
///
/// #[derive(PartialEq, Debug)]
/// struct User {
///     id: i32,
///     name: String,
/// }
///
/// impl Queryable<users::SqlType, DB> for User {
///     type Row = (i32, String);
///
///     fn build(row: Self::Row) -> Self {
///         User {
///             id: row.0,
///             name: row.1.to_lowercase(),
///         }

//
// See the comment under `FromSqlRow`. All of the same impls conflict there that
// would here. If we had `#[derive(FromSqlRow)]`, we would also have that
// implement `Queryable`. I know it doesn't look like the `Option` impl
// conflicts, but it definitely does -- It covers types which implement
// `Queryable` but not `FromSqlRow`, while this impl wouldn't.
//
// The same "we could remove one of these traits" applies. Really `FromSqlRow`
// is the only trait that *needs* to exist. At the end of the day, `FromSql` is
// meant to be "I only want to deal with deserializing a single field" case, and
// `Queryable` is meant to be easier to implement by hand than `FromSqlRow`
// would be.

/// Deserializes the result of a query constructed with [`sql_query`].
///
/// # Deriving
///
/// To derive this trait, Diesel needs to know the SQL type of each field. You
/// can do this by either annotating your struct with `#[table_name =
/// "some_table"]` (in which case the SQL type will be
/// `diesel::dsl::SqlTypeOf<table_name::column_name>`), or by annotating each
/// field with `#[sql_type = "SomeType"]`.
///
/// If you are using `#[table_name]`, the module for that table must be in
/// scope. For example, to derive this for a struct called `User`, you will
/// likely need a line such as `use schema::users;`
///
/// If the name of a field on your struct is different than the column in your
/// `table!` declaration, or if you are deriving this trait on a tuple struct,
/// you can annotate the field with `#[column_name = "some_column"]`. For tuple
/// structs, all fields must have this annotation.
///
/// If a field is another struct which implements `QueryableByName`, instead of
/// a column, you can annotate that struct with `#[diesel(embed)]`
///

/// ### Deriving
///
/// This trait can [be automatically derived](derive@QueryId)
/// by Diesel.
/// For example, given this struct:
///
/// If the SQL generated by a struct is not uniquely identifiable by its type,
/// meaning that `HAS_STATIC_QUERY_ID` should always be false,
/// you should not derive this trait.
/// In that case you should manually implement it instead.
pub trait QueryId {
    /// A type which uniquely represents `Self` in a SQL query.
    ///
    /// Typically this will be a re-construction of `Self` using the `QueryId`
    /// type of each of your type parameters. For example, the type `And<Left,
    /// Right>` would have `type QueryId = And<Left::QueryId, Right::QueryId>`.
    ///
    /// The exception to this is when one of your type parameters does not
    /// affect whether the same prepared statement can be used or not. For
    /// example, a bind parameter is represented as `Bound<SqlType, RustType>`.
    /// The actual Rust type we are serializing does not matter for the purposes
    /// of prepared statement reuse, but a query which has identical SQL but
    /// different types for its bind parameters requires a new prepared
    /// statement. For this reason, `Bound` would have `type QueryId =
    /// Bound<SqlType::QueryId, ()>`.
    ///
    /// If `HAS_STATIC_QUERY_ID` is `false`, you can put any type here
    /// (typically `()`).
    type QueryId: Any;

    /// Can the SQL generated by `Self` be uniquely identified by its type?
    ///
    /// Typically this question can be answered by looking at whether
    /// `unsafe_to_cache_prepared` is called in your implementation of
    /// `QueryFragment::walk_ast`. In Diesel itself, the only type which has
    /// `false` here, but is potentially safe to store in the prepared statement
    /// cache is a boxed query.
    const HAS_STATIC_QUERY_ID: bool = true;

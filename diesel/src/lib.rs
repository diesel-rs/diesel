//! # Diesel
//!
//! Diesel is an ORM and query builder designed to reduce the boilerplate for database interactions.
//! If this is your first time reading this documentation,
//! we recommend you start with the [getting started guide].
//! We also have [many other long form guides].
//!
//! [getting started guide]: https://diesel.rs/guides/getting-started/
//! [many other long form guides]: https://diesel.rs/guides
//!
//! # Where to find things
//!
//! ## Declaring your schema
//!
//! So Diesel is able to validate your queries at compile time,
//! it requires you to specify your schema in your code,
//! which you can do with [the `table!` macro][`table!`].
//! `diesel print-schema` or `infer_schema!` can be used
//! to automatically generate these macro calls
//! (by connecting to your database and querying its schema).
//!
//! [`table!`]: macro.table.html
//!
//! ## Getting started
//!
//! Queries usually start from either a table, or a function like [`update`].
//! Those functions can be found [here](#functions).
//!
//! Diesel provides a [`prelude` module](prelude),
//! which exports most of the typically used traits and types.
//! We are conservative about what goes in this module,
//! and avoid anything which has a generic name.
//! Files which use Diesel are expected to have `use diesel::prelude::*;`.
//!
//! [`update`]: fn.update.html
//!
//! ## Constructing a query
//!
//! The tools the query builder gives you can be put into these three categories:
//!
//! - "Query builder methods" are things that map to portions of a whole query
//!   (such as `ORDER` and `WHERE`). These methods usually have the same name
//!   as the SQL they map to, except for `WHERE` which is called `filter` in Diesel
//!   (To not conflict with the Rust keyword).
//!   These methods live in [the `query_dsl` module](query_dsl).
//! - "Expression methods" are things you would call on columns
//!   or other individual values.
//!   These methods live in [the `expression_methods` module](expression_methods)
//!   You can often find these by thinking "what would this be called"
//!   if it were a method
//!   and typing that into the search bar
//!   (e.g. `LIKE` is called `like` in Diesel).
//!   Most operators are named based on the Rust function which maps to that
//!   operator in [`std::ops`][]
//!   (For example `==` is called `.eq`, and `!=` is called `.ne`).
//! - "Bare functions" are normal SQL functions
//!   such as `sum`.
//!   They live in [the `dsl` module](dsl).
//!   Diesel only supports a very small number of these functions.
//!   You can declare additional functions you want to use
//!   with [the `sql_function!` macro][`sql_function!`].
//!
//! [`std::ops`]: //doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/ops/index.html
//! [`sql_function!`]: macro.sql_function.html
//!
//! ## Serializing and Deserializing
//!
//! Types which represent the result of a SQL query implement
//! a trait called [`Queryable`].
//!
//! Diesel maps "Rust types" (e.g. `i32`) to and from "SQL types"
//! (e.g. [`diesel::sql_types::Integer`]).
//! You can find all the types supported by Diesel in [the `sql_types` module](sql_types).
//! These types are only used to represent a SQL type.
//! You should never put them on your `Queryable` structs.
//!
//! To find all the Rust types which can be used with a given SQL type,
//! see the documentation for that SQL type.
//!
//! To find all the SQL types which can be used with a Rust type,
//! go to the docs for either [`ToSql`] or [`FromSql`],
//! go to the "Implementors" section,
//! and find the Rust type you want to use.
//!
//! [`Queryable`]: deserialize/trait.Queryable.html
//! [`diesel::sql_types::Integer`]: sql_types/struct.Integer.html
//! [`ToSql`]: serialize/trait.ToSql.html
//! [`FromSql`]: deserialize/trait.FromSql.html
//!
//! ## Getting help
//!
//! If you run into problems, Diesel has a very active Gitter room.
//! You can come ask for help at
//! [gitter.im/diesel-rs/diesel](https://gitter.im/diesel-rs/diesel)

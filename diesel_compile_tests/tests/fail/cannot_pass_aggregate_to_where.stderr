    = help: the trait `MixedAggregates<diesel::expression::is_aggregate::No>` is not implemented for `diesel::expression::is_aggregate::Yes`
    = note: you tried to combine expressions that aggregate over a certain column with expressions that don't aggregate over that column
    = note: try to either use aggregate functions like `min`/`max`/… for this column or add the column to your `GROUP BY` clause
    = note: also there are clauses like `WHERE` or `RETURNING` that does not accept aggregate expressions at all
help: the following other types implement trait `MixedAggregates<Other>`

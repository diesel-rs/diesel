   |                        ^^^^^^ the trait `MixedAggregates<diesel::expression::is_aggregate::No>` is not implemented for `diesel::expression::is_aggregate::Yes`

   = note: you tried to combine expressions that aggregate over a certain column with expressions that don't aggregate over that column
   = note: try to either use aggregate functions like `min`/`max`/â€¦ for this column or add the column to your `GROUP BY` clause
   = note: also there are clauses like `WHERE` or `RETURNING` that does not accept aggregate expressions at all
   = help: the following other types implement trait `MixedAggregates<Other>`:
             `diesel::expression::is_aggregate::Yes` implements `MixedAggregates<diesel::expression::is_aggregate::Never>`
             `diesel::expression::is_aggregate::Yes` implements `MixedAggregates<diesel::expression::is_aggregate::Yes>`
   = note: required for `Grouped<Gt<count<Integer, id>, Bound<BigInt, i64>>>` to implement `NonAggregate`
   = note: required for `SelectStatement<FromClause<users::table>>` to implement `FilterDsl<diesel::expression::grouped::Grouped<diesel::expression::operators::Gt<diesel::expression::count::count_utils::count<diesel::sql_types::Integer, columns::id>, diesel::expression::bound::Bound<BigInt, i64>>>>`

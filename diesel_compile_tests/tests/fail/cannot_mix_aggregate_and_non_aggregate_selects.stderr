LL | #[declare_sql_function]
   | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ unsatisfied trait bound introduced in this `derive` macro
   = note: 1 redundant requirement hidden
   = note: required for `f<nullable_int_col, max<Nullable<Integer>, nullable_int_col>>` to implement `ValidGrouping<()>`
   = note: required for `SelectStatement<FromClause<users::table>>` to implement `SelectDsl<f<nullable_int_col, max<Nullable<Integer>, ...>>>`

      = note: this error originates in the derive macro `ValidGrouping` which comes from the expansion of the attribute macro `declare_sql_function` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
